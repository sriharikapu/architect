Decentralized self-governance for cities

## Problem
- Current government entities do not consider the needs of all citizens (discrimination)
Citizens can skew/jeopardize the outcome of a proposal by having equal say on a problem/solution 
that does not affect them directly.
- Often, citizens do not have access to project proposals plans after they’ve been voted to be 
  executed. What and how money is used for the community is not readily transparent.
- The current model does not account for bias; citizens may subconsciously vote for/against a 
  proposal simply because of who the proposal is coming from/who supports it.
- According to current laws, citizens may propose bills to their local government, but they 
  must find a local representative to “sponsor” their bill so that it is able to be petitioned 
  to the other voting members of the council. Other citizens may be wholly unaware of a law 
  proposal because of representative “gatekeepers.” However, because of bias, citizens’ 
  proposals face the consequence of being outright rejected without any (valid) reason or 
  conversation.
- City Council members change only every 4 years (Denver). This means the same people vote 
  on any given category of a proposal and it’s in the hands of the community to sway council 
  members decisions to get the outcome desired (or lack thereof) of a bill proposal, rather 
  than having the citizens vote themselves.
- Lack of education, resources, and access/transparency prevent citizens from being 
  well-informed about city council procedures, personal rights, and the bill proposal processes. 
- In the current system, citizens are allowed to attend public hearings and offer their 
  opinions on legislation on the meeting agenda. However, their power over the passing of the 
  proposed bill (or lack thereof) extends as far as publically commenting on the proposal 
  themselves. They are not involved in the voting process. Therefore, council members are 
  required to hold these meetings by law, but are not required to listen or consider to any of 
  the citizens’ opinions. 

## Solution
- All citizens will have the ability to have their proposals/needs heard by the entire 
  community through Architect.
- Architect instills a contribution-based voting system on proposals. Every citizen 
  will have the ability to vote on any proposal, but citizens that would be directly 
  affected by the outcome of the bill with have votes with more weight. For example, citizens 
  with children attending school will have heavier weighted votes when education policies are
  up for vote.
- Utilizing smart contracts(proposals) on Ethereum and open sourcing the software built 
  for Architects eradicates the problem of transparency. The bill execution procedure 
  will be outlined in the proposal before the voting process starts so the voters can clearly see:

## What is being voted on
- Logistics required for bill to be executed. (i.e building schools: contracting company 
  appointed to that job).
- An estimation of the money required to complete the project and where and for what 
  specifically every cent of that money is spent on. Proposals will also be required to include a 
  complete cost break down (how funds will be spent) and a outline of how the given value was 
  determined. 
- Architect is designed to allow proposal creators and voters to interact with the app 
  anonymously. This way, citizens are challenged to base their decision on the proposal alone. 
  This eliminates the need to reduce bias associated with voting by disallowing the bias to ever 
  be formed initially. 
- Because Architect is a decentralized self-governance app, there are no gatekeepers. Proposals 
  are created by everyone, and viewed by everyone in the municipality. 
- There is no governing body determining the livelihood of the citizens. Just the citizens 
  themselves creating the environment they want. 
- Not only will every citizen have access to this app, but Architect contains a forum where 
  citizens can discuss bill proposals from the period of the proposal creation until the voting 
  process. This fosters community as well as allows an avenue for passive education about 
  Architect and its’ features and passive involvement in city’s legislative processes. 
  This replaces the “public hearing” aspect of the modern municipal legislation system. 
- (missing something about what catalyzes voting period.)

## Technical Breakdown
Architect leverages the smart contracts provided by DAOStack to build a simple shared 
voting economy

## Team Members
- Elliot Oliveira - Elliot has recently transitioned from the medical field to the technical 
  industry after finding a passion for full-stack web development.
- Tia (TJ) King -  TJ, iOS developer and budding data scientist, has been in the 
  technical industry for 7 years by means of education, extracurricular activities and 
  industry work. After attending a 3-year STEM summer program at Stanford University, 
  TJ attended Carleton College as a Linguistics Major. During college, she worked as an 
  iOS developer intern at Facebook Inc, an IT/Recruiting intern at Mesosphere (develops software 
  for data centers based on Apache Mesos) and an Attorney Partnerships Intern at Axiom Law 
  (provides tech-enabled legal, contracts, and compliance solutions for large enterprises). 
- Willie Johnson - After teaching himself iOS dev and building a mobile application, Willie
- Rohan Mishra - Rohan has organized over 100 technical education events for identities 
  underrepresented in the industry. He has also worked with members of the Iota team to 
  create experimental potential use cases for the Iota tangle. Mishra is a full-stack web 
  developer as well as blockchain developer. In addition to his technical and philanthropic 
  efforts, he holds extensive experience with project management. These skills were 
  demonstrated through the created of Architect.v.0. as his responsibilities included: 
  solidifying project scope, determining technologies to be utilized, writing the 
  interaction with Storj and DAOStack

## Issues and Concerns
### Resource abuse to obtain a weightier vote. 
Currently v.0. cannot verify whether the attributes that add categorial weight to a 
vote held by a user are valid. All elements for a user are self-reported. (i.e. if a user 
claims they have two kids, we cannot yet verify that this is true). This opens gateways 
for users to increase the weight of their vote on any given proposal and can potentially 
undermine the entire voting system. This will be addressed in v.1.

### Technical Access
In order for a citizen to vote, they are required to have a digital identity created 
on the blockchain. If a citizen doesn’t have access to technology they could potentially 
be completely barred from the decentralized local legislative processes. Architect was 
built with socially disenfranchised citizens in mind, but statistically these citizens 
have been occluded from technical access. We are hoping to use Architect to solve the 
problem it creates. These citizens may be granted access to the blockchain by proposal 
creation and acceptance.

## Conclusion
We proposed a weighted self governance system for municipalities on the ethereum blockchain. 
We created a proposal template that allows anonymous/transparent submissions to help 
eliminate bias in the governing process. We implemented a weighted voting system to 
instill a fair but sensical method of proposal acceptance and execution. Anonymous and 
transparent voting are also an integral aspect of the application so users will 
not be deterred from voting with integrity and truthfulness. The application will 
contain a forum to foster community and collaboration amongst citizens as well as 
decrease the onboarding learning curve for future locals.
