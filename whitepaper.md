# Architect
Decentralized self-governance for cities

# Outline
## Problem
- Current government entities do not consider the needs of all citizens (discrimination)
- Citizens can skew/jeopardize the outcome of a proposal by having equal say on a 
  problem/solution that does not affect them directly.
- Often, citizens do not have access to project proposals plans after they’ve been voted to be 
  executed. What and how money is used for the community is not readily transparent.
- The current model does not account for bias; citizens may subconsciously vote for/against a 
  proposal simply because of who the proposal is coming from/who supports it.
According to current laws, citizens may propose bills to their local government, but they must find a local representative to “sponsor” their bill so that it is able to be petitioned to the other voting members of the council. Other citizens may be wholly unaware of a law proposal because of representative “gatekeepers.” However, because of bias, citizens’ proposals face the consequence of being outright rejected without any (valid) reason or conversation.
City Council members change only every 4 years (Denver). This means the same people vote on any given category of a proposal and it’s in the hands of the community to sway council members decisions to get the outcome desired (or lack thereof) of a bill proposal, rather than having the citizens vote themselves.
Lack of education, resources, and access/transparency prevent citizens from being well-informed about city council procedures, personal rights, and the bill proposal processes. 
In the current system, citizens are allowed to attend public hearings and offer their opinions on legislation on the meeting agenda. However, their power over the passing of the proposed bill (or lack thereof) extends as far as publically commenting on the proposal themselves. They are not involved in the voting process. Therefore, council members are required to hold these meetings by law, but are not required to listen or consider to any of the citizens’ opinions. 
Proposed Solution
All citizens will have the ability to have their proposals/needs heard by the entire community through Architect. 
Architect instills a contribution-based voting system on proposals. Every citizen will have the ability to vote on any proposal, but citizens that would be directly affected by the outcome of the bill with have votes with more weight. For example, citizens with children attending school will have heavier weighted votes when education policies are up for vote.
Utilizing smart contracts(proposals) on Ethereum and open sourcing the software built for Architects eradicates the problem of transparency. The bill execution procedure will be outlined in the proposal before the voting process starts so the voters can clearly see:
What is being voted on
Why the proposal was made
Logistics required for bill to be executed. (i.e building schools: contracting company appointed to that job).
An estimation of the money required to complete the project and where and for what specifically every cent of that money is spent on. Proposals will also be required to include a complete cost break down (how funds will be spent) and a outline of how the given value was determined. 
Architect is designed to allow proposal creators and voters to interact with the app anonymously. This way, citizens are challenged to base their decision on the proposal alone. This eliminates the need to reduce bias associated with voting by disallowing the bias to ever be formed initially. 
Because Architect is a decentralized self-governance app, there are no gatekeepers. Proposals are created by everyone, and viewed by everyone in the municipality. 
There is no governing body determining the livelihood of the citizens. Just the citizens themselves creating the environment they want. 
Not only will every citizen have access to this app, but Architect contains a forum where citizens can discuss bill proposals from the period of the proposal creation until the voting process. This fosters community as well as allows an avenue for passive education about Architect and its’ features and passive involvement in city’s legislative processes. This replaces the “public hearing” aspect of the modern municipal legislation system. 
(missing something about what catalyzes voting period.)
